## :notebook: Description

##### The CritHub app is a CRUD app which allows users to add reviews to a list of movies displayed on a grid of cards.

The user can use a form found on each of the movie cards to select a star rating, enter their name, and write a review that will be rendered onto the card once the 'Submit' button is clicked. Reviews created appear by mutating state.

##### This app was created with React as a project for the Front End Software Developer bootcamp program at [Promineo Tech](https://promineotech.com/).

## :star: Features

##### Movie Card
* All of the movie objects stored in an array are rendered in a grid of cards.
* Each card renders the movie poster image, the title, director name(s), release year, runtime, genre badges, and age rating.

##### Review Form
* The review form is rendered on the movie card below the movie's metadata.
* The review form features a star rating component which animates as the user selects a star rating.
* The form takes the star rating, user name, and typed review.

##### Rendered Reviews
* Once the 'Submit' button is clicked, the reviews are rendered at the bottom of the card in a scrollable div.
